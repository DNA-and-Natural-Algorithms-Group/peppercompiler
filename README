== Basic usage ==

Run
	python compile.py circuit

to compile "circuit.sys" or "circuit.comp" and produce "circuit.des" (for 
Joe's designer). You can fix sequences by listing them in a "circuit.fixed" file.

Process "circuit.des" with a designer. There is a wrapper for Erik's SpuriousC 
in "design/". Run
  python spurious_design.py circuit

to produce "circuit.mfe".

Then,
	python finish.py circuit

to run Multisim on the designed sequences and produce the strands-to-order file
"circuit.strands".

== Examples ==

The "examples/" directory has some instructive examples.

== Requirements ==

Code works with Python 2.4.3+.
Suggested using 2.5+ so that parse errors are more readable.

Requires pyparsing 1.5.1+ (currently included in the directory).
