== Basic usage ==

Run
	python compile.py circuit

to compile "circuit.sys" or "circuit.comp" and produce "circuit.des" (for 
Joe's designer).

Process "circuit.des" with a designer. There is a simple random designer 
provided in "design/". Run
  python random_design.py circuit.des

to produce "circuit.mfe".

Then,
	python compiler.py circuit.save

to run Multisim on the designed sequences.

== Examples ==

The "examples/" directory has some instructive examples.

== Requirements ==

Code works with Python 2.4.3+.
Suggested using 2.5+ so that parse errors are more readable.

Requires pyparsing 1.5.1+ (currently included in the directory).
