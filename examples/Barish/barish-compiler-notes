=== First verify the compilation of a single tile

python ../../compiler.py DAOEtile5up.comp
python ../../design/spurious_design.py DAOEtile5up.des

  the above doesn't work, as of 10/10/09, but the below works well. 

python ../../compiler.py --pil DAOEtile5up.comp
python ../../design/spurious_design.py --keep-temp DAOEtile5up.pil
python ../../design/spurious_design.py --keep-temp --struct DAOEtile5up.pil

  the --struct option keeps the strands in each tile "together" for SpuriousC

=== Now compile the Variable Width system

python ../../compiler.py --pil VariableWidth.sys
python ../../design/spurious_design.py --keep-temp VariableWidth.pil
